Hello, this page is WIP, if you see this message, please come back in a few days ;)

## Who am I ?

Hello, I'm Alexandre, a French developer located in Nantes with 10 years of experience in development, including 5 years as a front-end engineer mainly in Angular (AngularJS/Angular 2+).
I am commited to my work, because I love it, and because I like how it feels to end a day being proud of the accomplished work.
I got a resume down there, but if you want a bit of context here it is :

I was a database developer (PL/SQL), then a database administrator. But with time my projects were all the same and I felt like I was not evolving the way I wanted.
So, I decided with my management to do other things, being in love with design and front-end development, I followed this path.

I started as a front-end dev, then became lead front-end, then I led my team of 3 to 5 developers (I did pass a Scrum Master certification at this point).

After this success, I grew up, and finally was supervising the work of 15+ front-end developers (I was in charge of the UI/UX, the design system, the best practices, training, meetings and so on).

But after more than 9 years at the same company I wanted to see something else, and I wanted to enhance my skills as a web integrator so I went Free-lance as a web integrator.

Things were great and one of my clients internalized me. Everything were on-tracks until my manager left the ship (we were a 2 man team), and the direction is not willing to replace him. In fact, loosing him made everything a bit difficult because the direction do not understand how it is important to have a front-end specialist and a back-end specialist and that one person cannot do it all.

So here I am now, looking for a company which is dynamic, willing to produce state of the art code, knows that quality is the way to go, and that one person can do a lot of things, but you do not need some "Jack of all trades, master of none". You need a "Jack of many trades, master of some".
